      <h2> My hobbies </h2>
  <p>I really like sports and various activities - running, hiking in the mountains, walking. In 2019, I participated in the Athens Classic Marathon and ran 42 km from the village of Marathon to the city of Athens (Greece). It was a very big challenge for me. But I love to challenge myself, set ambitious goals and achieve them. Now I face a new challenge: to get a new profession almost from scratch.</p>
    <p> Another hobby is social media. For example, I have my own YouTube channel where I share my life experience with other people:</p>

    <div><h2> New challenges </h2>
  <p>More than 5 months ago, a war broke out in my country. And I was forced to leave Ukraine with my son. And for almost 4 months we have been living in the UK, in the city of Cheltenham. Unfortunately, my professions, which I received in Ukraine, are now of no value in a new country. And I need a new profession that has great prospects and will be in demand in any country in the world. So I decided to learn programming. Although I have never encountered this profession before, and this is a new field for me.</p>
  <p>Another challenge is improving my English. I understand that in order to succeed in a foreign country and in a new profession, it is important for me to be fluent in English. Because programming is not only creating websites and writing scripts. It is also communication skills, co-working, co-creativity and coordination of efforts. And to clearly understanding each other is extremely important in this profession. Therefore, I go to foreign language courses and study English.</p>
